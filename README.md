# 🧪 Agentic Coding Lab

> **A research laboratory for the next generation of software engineering: AI-Agent Orchestration.**

Welcome to the **Agentic Coding Lab**. This repository serves as a knowledge hub for exploring, dissecting, and mastering the workflows of "Agentic Coding"—where developers don't just write code, but orchestrate systems of AI agents to build software.

## 🧭 Mission

The goal of this lab is to document and standardize distinct methodologies for working with AI Agents. We move beyond simple "chat-based coding" (Vibe Coding) to **Systematic Agent Orchestration**.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

### 1. The BMAD Method
*Business Methodology and Architecture Development*

A disciplined, phase-based framework for converting natural language into enterprise-grade software. It bridges the gap between a vague idea and executable code through strict architectural scaffolding.

- **[Architecture Analysis](en/understand-bmad/BMAD-Architecture-Analysis.md)**: How BMAD is structured.
- **[Workflow Deep Dive](en/understand-bmad/BMAD-Workflow-Deep-Dive.md)**: The 5 phases of development.
- **[Command Execution Logic](en/understand-bmad/BMAD-Command-Execution-Logic.md)**: How slash commands drive the agent engine.

### 2. Beads: Agent Task Management
*The "Jira" for AI Agents*

A specialized issue tracking system designed for agents, solving the "Agent Amnesia" problem by persisting context and state outside the context window.

- **[Understanding Beads](en/understand-beads.md)**: Why Markdown tasks fail and how Beads succeeds.

### 3. Claude Code Mastery
*Advanced V2 Guide*

Techniques for controlling the most powerful coding agent currently available, focusing on deterministic behavior via hooks and enforcement layers.

- **[Claude Code Newbie to Pro](en/understand-claude-code-newbie.md)**: Global scaffolding, hooks, and security gates.
