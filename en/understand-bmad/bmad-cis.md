## 1. The Essence of CIS in the BMAD Ecosystem

Many mistakenly believe BMAD is just a tool for fast coding (Coding Agent). However, if you only write code without knowing *what* to write and *why*, the project will still fail.

**CIS (Creative Innovation Suite)** is designed to be the "Right Hemisphere" of the BMAD system.
- If **Core/BMM/GDS** are the muscles and limbs for execution (How to build).
- Then **CIS** is the brain for thinking, research, and direction (What to build & Why).

CIS transforms BMAD from a "Programming Machine" into a **Comprehensive Startup Studio**, where ideas are nurtured from incubation.

## 2. Core Capabilities

Based on the `.claude/commands/bmad*` directory structure and specialized Agents, CIS provides 4 pillars of power:

### 2.1. Research & Strategy
Before starting any project, you need to understand the market.
- **Agent:** `Innovation Strategist`
- **Function:** Trend analysis, competitor research, product strategy definition.
- **Commands:** `/cis:innovation-strategy`, `/cis:problem-solving`.

### 2.2. Design Thinking
Helps solve complex issues (Wicked Problems) by placing the user at the center.
- **Agent:** `Design Thinking Coach`
- **Function:** Guide Empathy Maps, Customer Journeys, and Brainstorming to find breakthrough solutions.
- **Commands:** `/cis:design-thinking`.

### 2.3. Content Creation & Storytelling
A good product needs a good story. Good code needs easy-to-understand documentation.
- **Agent:** `Storyteller`, `Presentation Master`
- **Function:** Turn dry technical specs into inspiring stories (Pitch Decks, Landing Page content, User Stories).
- **Commands:** `/cis:storytelling`.

### 2.4. Creative Unblocking
When you are stuck for ideas, CIS acts as a coach.
- **Agent:** `Creative Problem Solver`
- **Function:** vitalize thinking using techniques like SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats.

## 3. Workflow Integration

CIS does not operate in isolation but is the stepping stone (Pre-game) for the software development process.

1.  **Phase 1: CIS - Discovery**
    *   Use `/cis:innovation-strategy` to finalize the idea.
    *   Use `/cis:storytelling` to write the Vision Statement.

2.  **Phase 2: Party Mode - Convergence**
    *   Convene a `/core:party-mode` meeting.
    *   Invite `Innovation Strategist` (from CIS) to sit with `Architect` (from BMM).
    *   The Master Agent will orchestrate to ensure creative ideas (CIS) are technically feasible (BMM).

3.  **Phase 3: BMM/GDS - Execution**
    *   Hand over documentation from CIS to become PRD, User Stories, and start coding.

## 4. Why Separate the Research Module?

In BMAD v6, although the meeting feature (Party Mode) has been moved to Core, the **Knowledge & Skills Library (Skills & Agents)** of CIS is kept separate. The reasons are:

- **Different Mindsets:** Coding Agents need precision and logic (low `temperature`). CIS Agents need to be flighty and multidimensionally linked (high `temperature`).
- **Focus:** When you are in Research mode, you don't want to be disturbed by Syntax Errors. You need a pure space for ideas.

## 5. Conclusion

**Bmad CIS** is proof of the philosophy: *"Technology is just a tool, Mindset is the destination"*.
Use CIS to ensure that you are not just building the thing right, but building the right thing.
