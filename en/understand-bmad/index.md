## 📂 Learning Path

Read the documents in the following order to understand how BMAD operates:

### 1️⃣ Overview Level: System Architecture
Understand the directory structure, layers, and how BMAD interprets into Claude Code.
- **Document**: [BMAD Architecture Analysis](./BMAD-Architecture-Analysis.md)
- **Key Content**: `_bmad/` directory structure, Dispatch model, and preliminary command taxonomy.

### 2️⃣ Process Level: Workflows
Learn about the user journey, development phases, and the difference between Greenfield vs. Brownfield projects.
- **Document**: [BMAD Workflow Deep Dive](./BMAD-Workflow-Deep-Dive.md)
- **Key Content**: 5-phase journey, operation flow chart, and artifact system.

### 3️⃣ Technical Level: Execution Mechanism
Deep dive into how slash commands translate into actual AI actions via execution engines.
- **Document**: [Command & Execution Logic](./BMAD-Command-Execution-Logic.md)
- **Key Content**: Anatomy of a Command, comparing Step-file Workflow vs XML Task Engine (`workflow.xml`).

### 4️⃣ Advanced Modules & Research
